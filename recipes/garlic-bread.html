    <h1>GARLIC BREAD</h1>

    <h3><b><u>Description</u></b></h3>
    <p>
        Garlic bread (also called garlic toast)[1] consists of bread (usually a baguette, sour dough, or bread such as ciabatta), 
        topped with garlic and olive oil or butter and may include additional herbs, such as oregano or chives.[2] 
        It is then either grilled until toasted or baked in a conventional or bread oven.[2]
    </p>
    <p>
        It is typically made using a French baguette, or sometimes ciabatta which is partially sliced downwards, 
        allowing the condiments to soak into the loaf while keeping it in one piece. The bread is then stuffed 
        through the cuts with oil and minced garlic before baking. Alternatively, butter and garlic powder are used, 
        or the bread is cut lengthwise into separate slices which are individually garnished.
